 # TradingView to TradingStrategy.ai algorithmic DeFi trading strategy conversion

This is an example Python project how to convert a TradingView based PineScript algorithmic 
trading strategy to [TradingStrategy.ai](https://tradingstrategy.ai) Python format.

This example repository was made for [Avalanche Summit II workshop](https://tradingstrategy.ai/blog/avalanche-summit-ii-workshop).

## Benefits of DeFi trading

Running your trading strategy on [decentralised exchanges](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/decentralised-exchange) instead of centralised exchanges have several benefits:

- Execute your strategy in a counterparty risk free manner 
- Broker free, direct to exchange
- Have 100% control of your strategy market data and live execution
- [Low trading fees on efficient decentralised markets](https://tradingstrategy.ai/blog/most-efficient-market-is-on-a-public-blockchain-and-decentralised)
- Convert your trading algorithm to a on-chain fund
  - Benefits of rich Python quant finance libraries like `pandas_ta` and `quantmetrics`=

## About the example strategy

The example strategy is a simplified [Bollinger band](https://github.com/tradingstrategy-ai/tradingview-defi-strategy) strategy.
**Whether it makes profit or not is outside the scope of the example.** The strategy is not optimised at all and parameters
are picked more or less by a gut feeling. Please use this example as learning material and base for your own strategies. 

- Use Bollinger Band's to determine entrys and exists
- Long only - suitable for [DEX spot markets](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/spot-market)
- Daily timeframe for candles
- Backtesting period of 2022-01-01 - 2023-04-01
- Use a tight stop loss when entering a position
  - This will result to multiple positions closed for stop loss and few profitable positions during the market rally

- We target the following live trading pairs 
  - [ETH/USDC pair on Uniswap v3 on Polygon with 5 BPS fee tier](https://tradingstrategy.ai/trading-view/polygon/uniswap-v3/eth-usdc-fee-5).
    See a note about this in `decide_trades()` Python code.
  - Against [Coinbase ETH/USDC 60 BPS taker fee](https://help.coinbase.com/en/exchange/trading-and-funding/exchange-fees) (12x more expensive than DeFi)

- Both strategy implementations take a low number of positions, 10-20 positions for the backtesting period
  
**Note**: Long only strategies are challenging in a descending or sideways cryptocurrencies market like 2021-2023.

### Technical indicator documentation

Find documentation for technical indicators used in the example

- [Exponential moving average (EMA)](https://tradingstrategy.ai/docs/programming/api/technical-analysis/overlap/help/pandas_ta.overlap.ema.html#ema):
  The Exponential Moving Average is a more responsive moving average compared to the Simple Moving Average (SMA). The weights are determined by alpha which is proportional to itâ€™s length. 

- [Relative strength indicator (RSI)](https://tradingstrategy.ai/docs/programming/api/technical-analysis/momentum/help/pandas_ta.momentum.rsi.html#rsi):
  The Relative Strength Index is a popular momentum oscillator used to measure the velocity as well as the magnitude of directional price movements.

- [Bollinger bands](https://tradingstrategy.ai/docs/programming/api/technical-analysis/volatility/help/pandas_ta.volatility.bbands.html#bbands):
  A popular volatility indicator by John Bollinger.

## Comparing the strategy results

Both strategies open positions in a similar fashion, so they are more or less comparable.

**Because of the different price feeds and other subtle differences you cannot have the same strategy backtest
    result on two different markets**.

### Algorithm porting notes

At least some of positions like ~Jul 20th are opened around the same time, 
so we do see that the strategy is following the same pattern.

### Summary of the strategy performance

A lot of stop losses are triggered as expected. On TradingView the losses on a stop are deeper than the target 0.25%,
because of how PineScript backtesting is structured - it cannot use more accurate stop loss signal for daily candles,
like Trading Strategy is doing.

### Equity curve

How well the strategy would have historically performed on ETH-USDC pair on Uniswap v3 on Polygon (5 BPS fee).

![equity curve trading strategy](./screenshots/equity-curve.png)

How well the strategy would have historically performed on ETH-USDC on Coinbase (no fees).

![equity curve coinbase](./screenshots/equity-curve-coinbase.png)

However, if we switch on 50 BPS taker fee on Coinbase we can see it destroys the strategy performance,
going for break even to -7% PnL.

### Price action

We can compare price action views between Jupyter Notebook and TradingView.

## Notable differences between Python and PineScript

Some major differences between Python and PineScript:

- Python is a general-purpose programming language, making a vast number of tutorials, books and courses available for it.
- Python is open source - making a vast number of software libraries like technical indicators and statistics available for it.
- TradingView's PineScript is optimised to be used with their service only. It is streamlined, easier to work with,
  but inflexible.
- PineScript is fast: backtests complete fast as it is simplified what PineScript can do. 
- Python data is presented as Pandas DataFrame's - the de facto core unit of any data science,
  whereas TradingView uses its own data format.
- Trading Strategy's `decide_trades()` function is designed to suit all kind of strategies, including portfolio construction, lending strategies,
  liquidity provider positions and such. Thus, it will return a list of trades to be executed on a blockchain to enter a new position
  and you have more finer-grained control than PineScript's entry/exit that has been designed for traditional stock markets.

Some differences traders should note:

- Trading Strategy use a term [position](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/position) to cover a trading position with entry and exit,
  where as TradingView is using a term *trade*. This might be confusing because a single position consists of multiple trades.
- Because the price feed is not 1:1 same (different exchanges),
  different trades will be taken at a different time
- Depending on a blockchain and DEX, the assets use wrapped token notation.
  E.g. `ETH` becomes `WETH`. This is due to the technical limitations of [EVM-compatible blockchains](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/evm-compatible).

Some differences programmer's should note:

- Python use the zero indexed arrays unlike PineScript that uses reverse arrays. In Python, like in most programming languages,
  the latest value of time series is in the last index of an array, noted by `-1` and the oldest value is in zero index `0`.
  In PineScript, this is the opposite, where the latest value is noted without index or index 0.

### Example of TradingView

- Import the script to TradingView
- Choose XXX/USD market
- Shwo the backtest results

### Example of Jupyter notebook

- Run in Visual Studio Code, as described below


## About trading on decentralised finance

### DEX trading fees

You have four elements of fees

- Blockchain transaction costs or [gas fees]()
  - Going towards zero and neglible in the future
- Trading fee, which consists of
  - [Liquidity provider fee](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/liquidity-provider) 
  - ...and [protocol fee](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/protocol-fee) 
  - Usually 0.05% for large Uniswap v3 pools, otherwise 0.25% - 0.30% on [AMMs](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/amm)
  - [Compares to 0.60% taker fee on Coinbase, others]()
- [Price impact](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/price-impact)
  - Unlike on order book exchanges, this is very easy to historically backtest on AMMs due to deterministic nature of the price
    based on liquidity
- [Slippage](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/slippage)
  - Price change between signing your transction and having a block producer to include it in a block 
  - Also important for [MEV protection](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/mev)
  - Usually orders are signed with maximum slippage
- AMM and [CLMM](https://tradingstrategy.ai/glossary/clmm) based DEXes do not have slippage

## Preqrequisites

### Skills

To work with this example, you need to have

- Basic experience in cryptocurrencies
- Basic experience in trading
- Experience in TradingView's PineScript
- Junior software developer level experience in Python

### Software 

- Python 3.10
- [Poetry package manager for Python](https://tradingstrategy.ai/community)
- Git

## Installation

Make a git clone of this repository and then run `poetry` to create a Python environment for your project.

```shell
poetry shell
poetry install
```

### API key

When you run the notebook for the first time, you will be prompted to register to give an API key for Trading Strategy datasets.

## Running backtest notebooks from terminal

Running the backtesting notebook in a terminal is the most robust, though not that useful method 

- Works always - you see if your code works
- Opens any charts separate windows in a web browser
- But it's very hard to work with notebooks in a terminal
- Using shell for notebooks allows e.g. you to use `ipdb` breakpoints in Python code.

How to run:

```shell
ipython bollinger_band_example_defi_strategy.ipynb 
```

This will open couple of browser tabs and print out the results

## Running backtest notebooks with Visual Studio Code

First start a server from command line

```shell
poetry shell
jupyter server 
```

Copy the kernel URL with the secret token from the console output.] 

Open any notebook in Visual Studio Code.

Use `Select Kernel` at the top right of the screen, choose Remot Jupyter Kernel, add URL option.
Paste in the URL  (should b e automatically pasted).

Run the notebook.
